\chapter{General topology}
\label{general_topology}
Now we are prepared to dive into the general topology (often called point-set topology).
Consider a set $X$. A topology is a set $\mathcal{T}_X \subseteq 2^X $ which members we call \textbf{open sets}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\varnothing, X\in \mathcal{T}_X$
	\item 
\end{enumerate}
