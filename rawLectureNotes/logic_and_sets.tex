\chapter{Logic and sets}
\label{logic_and_sets}

Logic is a huge and beautiful branch of mathematics. We will focus on it's basics, topic called "propositional calculus". It is a powerful machinery, that will be used later
to prove theorems and define new objects. Moreover, it gives a good grasp on Boolean algebras, a concept that we will later meet in topology.
