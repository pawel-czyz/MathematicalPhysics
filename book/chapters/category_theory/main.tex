\chapter{Category theory}
\label{chap:category_theory}

We have already covered basic propositional calculus and naive theory, what gave us a plenty of concepts. The most important were sets, functions and relations. As we will discover in this chapter, relationship between sets and functions is very subtle, and we will discover similar objects. To treat them "in the same way" we need to learn some language of the category theory. Our treatment will be very brief and non-exhaustive. We will develop more concepts, wherever needed.
