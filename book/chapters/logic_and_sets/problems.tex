\begin{exercise}
	Let $S\subseteq R$. We say that $S$ is \textbf{well-ordered} iff any non-empty subset $X\subset S$ has the smallest element.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Prove that reals and integers with the default ordering are not well-ordered.
		\item Assume that $X\subseteq \mathbb N$ doesn't have the smallest element. Define $$A=\{n\in \mathbb N : \{0,1,\dots,n\}\cap X=\emptyset\}$$
			and use mathematical induction to prove that $X$ is empty.
		\item Why are natural numbers well-ordered?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
