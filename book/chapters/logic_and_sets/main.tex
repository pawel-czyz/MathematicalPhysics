\chapter{Propositional calculus and sets}
\label{chap:propositional_calculus_and_sets}
To be able to formulate and prove theorems, we need a language. In this chapter we learn propositional calculus and naive set theory, language in which most of the mathematics is expressed. Our treatment will not be exhaustive in any ways.
