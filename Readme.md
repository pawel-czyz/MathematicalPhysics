# Mathematical Physics Course

### Aim
This repository supports Mathematical Physics Course organised at St. Hugh's College (University of Oxford). The aim is to provide formal and understandable introduction to differential geometry
and mathematical physics.

### What is in this repository?
Lecture notes (under active development) for people who would like to come but cannot and problem sets we solve during the classes. I strongly advise printing out problems
and taking them to the classes.
