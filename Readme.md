# Introduction to Mathematical Physics

### Aim
This set of notes is aimed at ambitious people, who would like to learn some basic mathematical physics, with special focus on techniques coming from differential geometry and algebraic topology. It assumes familarity with school-level mathematics (highschool algebra, how to formulate proofs), and strong willingness to learn more.

This started as a short course in Mathematical Physics organised at St Hugh's College, Oxford.
