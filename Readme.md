# Mathematical Physics Course

### Aim
This repository support Mathematical Physics Course organised at St. Hugh's College (University of Oxford). The aim is to provide formal and understandable introduction to differential geometry
and mathematical physics.

### What is in this repository?
Lecture notes (under active development) for people who would like to come but cannot and problem sets we solve during the classes. I strongly advise printing out problems
and taking them to the classes.

### Special thanks
Special thanks to prof. Don Grainger and St. Hugh's College, especially Ms. Megan Kerry, for making organisation of this course possible.
